regex-file-renamer
==================

This program was created as a student project for JAMK's Windows programming course, by Ville Jokela & James Pearce
The goal of the project was to make a mass regular expressions based file renamer
that can recursively search and rename files and/or folders based on the regex pattern.
The renamer will replace the patterns specified part of the file or folders name with what the user wants.


Installation
============

There are no additional steps required beyond compiling the executable.


Requirements
============

.NET version ?.? must be installed.


User guide
==========

The user interface is rather simple. The preview button shows a preview of changes
that will be done with the selected settings.
The execute button renames from the selected folder with the selected settings.

Future development
==================

Currently we have no known bugs and neither of us have any plans to develop this further.
However, if someone wants to improve this, it is open source and they are free to do so.
Possible improvements may include coloring the datagrid's rows based on warnings and
measures to prevent the user from shooting himself in the foot. 


Our work hours
==============
We spent many hours making this, roughly 30 hours. James focused on the UI, documentation and helping Ville with the renamer.
Ville did most of the renamer and provided feedback on the UI, documentation and filled in his part of the documentation.


Our opinion for a grade
======================= 

This program is not very broad. As a nice middle path we suggest we get at least 50% of the maximum 30 per person.
We believe the work was shared 50/50 between us.
